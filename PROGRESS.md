# Starhaven — live status

**Play:** https://spacepixelrts.pages.dev
**Bar:** StarCraft II (space RTS, base building, asymmetric factions) — blind, on the running game.
**Active goal:** **First Playable Skirmish** — one 12–18 minute iPad-first 4:3 loop: main menu ->
setup -> loading -> Helios Rift -> fog scouting -> faction economy -> ONE irreversible choice
between TWO technology paths per faction -> four-unit compact army -> shared-center conflict ->
destroy the enemy Core or lose -> results. Contract: `docs/FIRST_PLAYABLE.md`.

## Roles (active)

| Role | Who |
| --- | --- |
| Orchestrator — directs / reviews / scope-controls | Sol Max |
| Repository implementer — one bounded task at a time | Ox Alpha Max |
| Image-only critic — 3 independent critiques at important gates, visible categories only | DeepSeek V4 Flash Vision Max |

## Now

- Canonical vocabulary FROZEN: `docs/CANONICAL_VOCABULARY.md` (Starhaven `starhaven`; Sunweaver
  `sunweaver`; Gravemark `gravemark`; Helios Rift `helios-rift`; Core `core`; tech paths
  solar-ascendancy / sky-dominion / iron-colossus / rift-engineering; legacy vespari/aurion kept
  as private adapters until a dedicated migration; Nihiline/voidmarked hidden and deferred).
- Active branch `chatgptpro2008` tracking origin/chatgptpro2008.
- Current relevant commits: `9fc3067` differentiate faction opening economies · `f8c94f5` tactical
  pause control (pause-only so far) · `336659a` Starhaven start screen · `21e7c08` player
  direction docs · `a9acec2` shared presentation modules.
- Build passes (`tsc --noEmit && vite build`) on the branch tip.
- Gap analysis and frozen M0/M1 contracts recorded in `docs/FIRST_PLAYABLE_GAP_ANALYSIS.md`.
- **Next: M0** — deterministic game states + visual QA scenarios
  (`chore: add deterministic game states and visual QA scenarios`), then M1 front door, then the
  full loop. No content/polish work before the loop closes.

## Historical

Pre-First-Playable town-center art campaign (Sunweaver Town Center structural rebuild,
PTC-CLAY/PTC-MAT rounds, palette + lighting gates, toolchain switches) is archived here for its
commit references only:

- Clay geometry baseline accepted after rounds 12–13 (`5e57a47`, `741246b`, `3e1d9dc`,
  `a186e39`, `ed166c0`); materials/palette pass (`0452b04`, `87cea81`); structural viewer deployed
  and made interactive (`70b542d`). Objective gates held: p99 ~3–5 ms, console errors 0.
- Wave A visual foundation (iso projection P94, emissive team color P95, terrain elevation P96)
  previously PASSed; plan text preserved in `docs/ISO_REWRITE_PLAN.md` — historical, superseded by
  First Playable where they conflict.
- Iteration specs live under `docs/TOWN_CENTER_ITERATION_*.md` / `docs/PTC_*.md`.
